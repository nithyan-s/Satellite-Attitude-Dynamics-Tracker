#Author - Nithyan

Description: 
This project is a real-time application designed for filtering and analyzing satellite attitude data, specifically focusing on pitch, yaw, and roll telemetry. It reads raw telemetry data, extracts specific command events (enable-disable) and associated time intervals, and cross-references these with an external time log to calculate dump counts and other relevant statistics. The system is optimized for high-performance real-time operations and is built to provide precise monitoring and analysis of satellite orientation, ensuring the effective control and adjustment of satellite positioning.

Key Features:
- Real-time telemetry processing of pitch, yaw, and roll data.
- Efficient command filtering for enable-disable events.
- Cross-referencing with external log files for time-based data analysis.
- Calculation of satellite attitude dump counts for telemetry verification.
- Structured for high-performance, mission-critical environments.
